                    <h1>How to play the game.</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h2>Battle Royale</h2>
                            <p>
                                Teams fight in an ever shrinking map to be the<br>
                                last squad standing. All 60 players start in the main<br>
                                ship and can choose to land where they please, finding<br>
                                weapons, ammo, attachments and armour in care packages,<br>
                                supply bins and on the ground.<br>
                                Every few minutes the ring closes and the map gets tighter,<br>
                                forcing players to come out of hiding. Truly a game where<br>
                                <em>anything can happen.</em>
                                <br><br>
                                This mode can be played in either:
                                <ol>
                                    <li><h3>Solo</h3></li>
                                    <li><h3>Duos</h3></li>
                                    <li><h3>Trios</h3></li>
                                </ol>
                                Although many pros choose to go at it solo, an average team<br>
                                with passable communication and teamwork often make short work<br>
                                of even the most nimble and accurate predators, making Battle<br>
                                Royale - Trios the most popular game mode.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><h2>Arenas</h2>
                            A new mode added only 4 months ago and is quickly rising in popularity<br>
                            Arenas is Battle Royale refined.<br>
                            Without the chaos of landing somewhere and potentially having<br>
                            to fight off 4 squads (all trying to punch you to death), Arenas<br>
                            pits only two teams against each other, but in a much smaller map<br>
                            Both teams start in a safe spawn with limited points to buy some<br>
                            basic weapons before. The main difference is that downed players<br>
                            can not be brought back (like in Battle Royale). There are also<br>
                            material canisters on each map that can be collected to grant extra<br>
                            points for buying gear for the following rounds.<br>
                            Speaking of, rounds are played until one team wins with a two game<br>
                            lead or a stalemate is reached at 8 rounds and sudden death begins.<br>
                            A 'winner takes all' round where players get max armour and enough<br>
                            points to buy just about anything they want.
                        </li>

                        <li><h2>Ranked</h2>
                        Pretty much each of teh above, but withe a permanent score after each game.<br>
                        Each match has an entry cost of ranked points (RP), with more being earned<br>
                        through kills, surviving longer and thus placing in the top 10, then top 5<br>
                        and finally the top 3. Winning a match earns far more points than losing, but<br>
                        losing is sometimes just as profitable if you played well and killed the<br>
                        champion (each match has one, usually the top player from the preious match.)<br>
                        <br>
                        Ranking up consitently will move you through the ranks:
                        <br><br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Bronze</li>
                            <li>Silver</li>
                            <li>Gold</li>
                            <li>Platinum</li>
                            <li>Diamond</li>
                            <li>Masters</li>
                            <li>Predators</li>
                        </ol>
                        <br>
                        Apex Predator is the best of the best (if the name didn't give it away).<br>
                        There are only ever 100 people allowed in that rank, and those players are<br>
                        globally ranked.

                    "I know it is going to sound corny, but...<br>
                    I was there when it happened. When Apex Legends first came out!<br>
                    Overnight the game had become a success, and overnight it had<br>
                    taken most of the older playerbase of the king of battle royale<br>
                    games - Fortnite.<br>
                    Within a sinlge week of launch, Apex had over a million players.<br>
                    This is just unheard of, even today.<br>
                    You have to undestand, everyone was looking for 'the next big thing'<br>
                    ,but Respawn had already done it a year prior. They made Titanfall 2.<br>
                    Titanfall 2 was a big deal becasue it took first-person-shooters<br>
                    and made them into movement games with shooter elements.<br>
                    The actually did this back in 2014 with Titanfall 1, but it never<br>
                    really caught the mainstream's attention which sucked. Anyways.<br>
                    Apex Legends came out and used the Titanfall 2 movement system, and<br>
                    changed the landscape of shooters as we know it today.<br>
                    <br>
                    I highly recommend giving it a try, especially with 2 friends."<br>
