<!--Notes for reviewer:
1) I have been struggling with tis project for just under 3 weeks. It has been a pain and there has been no support.
I have booked mentor calls out the wazoo but nothing was available. The soonest i could get a call is... the 1st of October.
I have looked online for help and found explanations and examples and i simply do not understand the words.
It does not matter how many times i re-read the same jargon over and over if i do not have a 'mentor' to
to teach me.

2) The save for later page does not update.
I do not know why and have spent a good few days pulling my hair out over it.
Please leave helpful comments and code that resolves the issues. I have had some really bad and lazy reviews
of late that have essentailly just pointed out something and said 'yOu NeEd To FiX iT'.
